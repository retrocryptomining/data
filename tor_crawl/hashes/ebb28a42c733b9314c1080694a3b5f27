			<h2>Politics is a Good Thing!</h2>
<p class="prelude">The Youth Leadership Initiative at the University of Virginia Center for Politics is dedicated to increasing civic engagement by providing teachers with the best civics education materials and programs. Research shows that quality civics education programs are essential to creating lifelong citizenship and YLI programs empower students to take responsibility for our democracy.</p>
<p style="clear: both;">In 1998 UVA professor and Center for Politics Director Larry J. Sabato founded the Youth Leadership Initiative to combat the apathy and cynicism that he saw in his politics students. Professor Sabato believed that by creating quality civics education programs students would be energized to accept the responsibilities of citizenship and become lifelong participants in American democracy.</p>
Activities such as the yearly Mock Election, E-Congress, Democracy Corps, and YLI lesson plans do more than just teach about civics and government. Each program is infused with simulations and hands-on projects that connect students with the political process.  YLI is proud to be working with American Evolution to commemorate the arrival of the first Africans and women in significant numbers,  and the beginning of representative  government in America.  In preparation for 2019, YLI and American Evolution have created the digital First Freedom Wall.  The First Freedom Wall is a place where students can share ideas, comment on current issues, and think critically about our democracy.

The Youth Leadership Initiative (YLI) provides everything educators need to get their students in the game absolutely FREE of charge. There is no catch.
<h3>How to get started</h3>
Educators can sign up today FREE of charge. Upon registering educators will create a username and password that will access all of YLI’s resources and programs. E-mails will be sent to registered teachers periodically to remind them of upcoming events, new lesson plans and updated materials. If you are a student, community member, parent, or organization, see how you can bring the Youth Leadership Initiative to your school.

			&lt;p&gt;The <strong>Youth Leadership Initiative</strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.americanevolution2019.com" target="_blank">American Evolution</a> </strong>have partnered together to create an exciting new strategy for teaching critical thinking, civility, and the discussion of political topics in the classroom.  Both groups worked together to find a way to honor the legacy of self-government and diversity established at the Jamestown colony in 1619.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital First Freedom Wall was inspired by the <a href="http://www.tjcenter.org" target="_blank">Thomas Jefferson Center for Freedom of Expression</a>.  The physical Freedom Monument is a place for citizens to express themselves freely and share their ideas with others.  The digital First Freedom wall allows teachers to post comments, quotes, or headlines onto the website.  Students then logon and leave comments that their fellow studen can see and respond to.  YLI also has the ability to create National Topics to expand the conversation beyond the boundaries of the school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your students in the game with the digital First Freedom Wall from YLI and American Evolution!  Let's bring civility and political discourse back to the table. &lt;/p&gt;		</div>

<h3><a href="https://www.americanevolution2019.com/about/">In Partnership with the Youth Leadership Initiative</a></h3>
Committed to Democracy, Diversity and Opportunity towards the advancement of increased political education and participation
<h2>Share your students' voices with the country!</h2>
<h3>Use civility to express ideas and opinions!</h3>
The freedom of expression as guaranteed by the First Amendment has held a revered place in the heart of Americans and is the thread that binds the fabric of our democracy.  American Evolution and the Youth Leadership Initiative have teamed to help bring back the skills of discourse, debate and compromise that found their way to Jamestown in 1619 and are crucial to the functioning of American democracy. The First Freedom Wall emphasizes the skills of media literacy, critical thinking and effective communication.
<h3>[spacer height="15px"]</h3>
<h3> Communicate with students nation-wide with the "National First Freedom Wall"!</h3>
The National First Freedom Wall is a place for students to share their opinions about issues YLI believes are important to the understanding of American Democracy at this time in history.
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>The Wall will be updated regularly to reflect current events providing the opportunity for students to add their thoughts, concerns and ideas to the national discourse.</li>
 	<li>Practice the Rules of Civil Discourse by writing teacher approved comments to the First Freedom Wall.</li>
 	<li>Reflect on media literacy and the use of bias when sharing comments via the First Freedom Wall.</li>
 	<li>Build an appreciation for the diversity of the United States by reading and reflecting on the views of those from different communities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Practice the skills of democracy with our "Anytime Topics" option!</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Set up an independent First Freedom Wall for students in your classes only.</li>
 	<li>Customize your Freedom Wall to reflect issues or topics germane to your curriculum.</li>
 	<li>Assess student understanding by asking them to respond using the First Freedom Wall.</li>
 	<li>Gauge and measure sentiment on political issues while emphasizing respect and civility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The Freedom walls is an academic exercise.  The views expressed are those of participating students, not those of the Youth Leadership Initiative or the UVA Center for Politics.

			Elections can be confusing, especially depending on where you are registered to vote. Below we've listed and described all the different kinds of major elections, from primaries to conventions we've got it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h3></h3>
<h3>General Elections</h3>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">General elections are the last election conducted to determine who will fulfill the role in question. In most cases a single candidate from each party will be represented on the final ballot.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Primary</h3>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">A primary election is conducted to decide who will be the candidate on the general election ballot for a particular party. There are two different types of primaries: open and closed.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Closed Primary</h3>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">A closed primary requires a voter to choose to vote in either the Republican primary or the Democratic primary.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Open Primary</h3>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">An open primary allows a voter to participate in both the Republican and Democratic primary elections. Those primaries are generally held on separate days.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Caucus</h3>
<h3></h3>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">A caucus is a meeting of party members, it usually taking place on a local scale. Members of a particular political party will choose which candidate they would like to send either to a convention or to run in a general election.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Conventions</h3>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">Conventions are usually held on the national level. Representatives from each state, all of the same political party, will come together for several days to determine who should be the candidate for the general election. While conventions are most common for selecting a candidate for president they also exist for choosing gubernatorial and congressional candidates in states such as Michigan and Utah.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">The idea of federalism isn't always the easiest to understand. Local, state, and federal governments all have different responsibilities, yet they also all have different limits. Below we've listed some of the main responsibilities of each government. Some may even crossover.<a href="http://208.81.226.245/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Federalism.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2393" src="http://208.81.226.245/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Federalism.png" alt="Federalism" width="900" height="695" /></a></h3>

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">At YLI we realize that it isn't always easy to sort out the "<em>FAKE NEWS",</em> so we've done it for you. Below is a diagram that ranks news sources as a whole in two different ways. Up and down they are ranked on their accuracy and complexity, the farther down the chart they are the less accurate and true their stories. The higher up on the diagram, the more complex the analysis and accurate the source is.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">From left to right the stories are ranked based on their inherent political bias, the farther left a news source is the more liberal view it has. While the more to the right a source is the more conservative its view.</h4>

			<p>E-Congress is a simulation of the law-making process in the United States Congress. Over the course of this simulation, you will take on the role of a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, one of the two houses of Congress. You and your classmates have five phases to complete in E-Congress.</p>
<p>You are now beginning Phase I. During this phase you will learn more about the structure of Congress, the job of a Member of Congress, and the process of making laws. In later phases, you will conduct research on an issue that interests you, write a bill to submit to E-Congress, and review and vote on bills from other E-Congress students around the country.</p>

		</div>
			<div id="intro-congress-committees" class="box ">
			<p>Both the House of Representatives and the Senate are organized into <b>committees</b>. Committees are especially important in the House of Representatives because of its size.</p>
<p><b>Standing committees</b> are permanent committees that continue from one Congress to the next. In the 115th Congress, the House has <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/committee_info/scsoal.pdf " target ="pop">twenty standing committees</a>, each with an average of thirty-nine Members. Together, they have a total of 97 subcommittees that collectively act as the eyes, ears, and hands of the House.</p>
<p>Committees consider issues roughly parallel to those of the departments in the president's Cabinet. For example, there are committees on agriculture, education, the judiciary, veterans affairs, transportation, and commerce.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="intro-congress-members" class="box ">
			<p>The Speaker of the House presides over the House of Representatives and is the only officer of the House specifically mentioned in the Constitution. Other House leadership roles also are determined by membership in the majority or minority party. Party members also elect a majority leader and a minority leader, who both work closely with the speaker.</p>
<p>Each party also elects a whip, who is responsible for persuading Members to support their own party's position on issues. Whips serve as communication links, distributing information about the party's position on issues from leaders to Members and alerting leaders to the concerns of party members.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1351" title="Elephant and Donkey" src="http://yli-pub-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/intro_cartoon2.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" /></p>
<p><a href="http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/leadership.aspx" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view a list of House leaders and to visit their websites.</p>
<p>The majority party in the House of Representatives is the Republican Party making the Democratic Party the minority party.  The 115th Congress currently includes 239 Republican and 194 Democratic Members of the House. The Republican Party also holds the majority in the U.S. Senate with 51 versus 47 Democrats plus two Independents who caucus with them.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="intro-congress-parties" class="box ">
			<p>The House of Representatives has 435 Members. Every state has at least one Member. California has the most Members, with 53. How many Members represent your state in the House of Representatives? To check, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov" target="_blank">click here</a> and click on the Member Information tab and then use the second drop down menu.</p>
<p>Members of the House of Representatives are elected for two-year terms. Each term has two sessions that begin in January and last one year. The second session of the 115th Congress will begin on January 3, 2018.</p>
<p>Because it is so large, the House of Representatives has a complex structure and many rules. Leadership roles are especially important and are largely determined by <b>political party</b>. Traditionally, the most powerful leaders are members of the <b>majority party</b> - the party with the greatest number of Members elected to a particular session of Congress.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="intro-congress-structure" class="box ">
			<p>The United States Congress is the <b>legislative</b>, or law-making, branch of government created by Article I of the Constitution. Congress consists of two separate groups or houses - the Senate and the House of Representatives. This two-house organization is called a <b>bicameral legislature</b>. Each state is represented in the Senate by two senators, regardless of the state's population. The number of representatives each state sends to the House of Representatives, in contrast, is determined by that state's population. E-Congress is based on the House of Representatives.</p>

			<div id="intro-overview" class="box ">
			<p>When you have finished Phase I, you should be able to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) What is the structure of Congress?</li>
<li>2) What are the responsibilities of Members of Congress?</li>
<li>3) How does Congress make laws?</li>
</ul>

Your teacher may have already provided a copy to you. This will help you keep track of all of the information in this phase. Your teacher may be collecting this.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="intro-responsibilities" class="box ">
			<p>Members of Congress are elected to write and pass laws representing the views of their <b>constituents</b>. A constituent is a person who is represented by a specific elected official. For example, Bill De Blasio is the mayor of New York City, so his constituents are the residents of New York City. Every American as of January 20, 2017 is a constituent of President Trump. If you are a representative in the House, you need to support bills that are popular with your constituents. Otherwise, they will be unlikely to vote for you in the future!</p>
<p>This can be more complicated than it seems. Some political scientists feel that representatives have a duty to represent the whole nation, not just their own district, and the best way to do that is to listen to the opinions of their constituents and then use their own best judgment to make final decisions. Members of Congress also have to consider how laws they propose will be viewed by members of their political party. Members who do not vote with their party may find it difficult to get assigned to the committees that interest them.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="intro-political-ideology" class="box ">
			<p><img src="http://yli-pub-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/intro_cartoon2.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>Which political party do you belong to, Representative CURRENT_USER.LAST_NAME?</p>
<p>Many factors contribute to a person's choice of political party. Research indicates that the strongest factors are family and community influences. The platforms and positions of the two major parties can also have an influence, but these can change and evolve over time. For that reason, it is helpful to examine contemporary issues to be sure that your party preference matches your <b>political ideology</b>, or personal beliefs about government.</p>
<p>At this point students will take a political ideology survey.</p>		</div>
			<div id="intro-member-responsibilities" class="box ">
			Representatives must do office work, be present for votes and hearings, and attend meetings and events in Washington; they also need to be visible and available to their constituents at home. In addition to all the work of holding office, members of Congress also face the time-consuming demands of campaigning and fundraising. Keeping up with all these demands requires a supporting staff of people doing research and handling requests for assistance from individual constituents.		</div>
			<div id="intro-member-demographics" class="box ">
			<p>Congress is older, better educated, more white, more male, and richer than the rest of the United States. In the 115th Congress there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 African-Americans,</li>
<li>39 Hispanic-Americans,</li>
<li>15 Members of Asian or Native Hawaiian ancestry,</li>
<li>2 Native Americans.</li>
<li>The total number of women in Congress is 109. There are 21 in the Senate and 88 in the House, three of whom are non-voting delegates from Washington, DC, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</li>
<p>Does it make a difference if a representative or senator is male or female, African-American or Latino or Caucasian, young or old, gay or straight? Can a man represent the interests of women as well as a woman can? Can a rich woman represent the interests of the poor? Are veterans more sensitive to veterans' issues? Visit the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44762.pdf " target ="pop">Congressional Research Service</a> for more demographic information of the 115th Congress. </p>

		</div>
			<div id="intro-laws" class="box ">
			<p>The Constitution specifically gives to Congress its most important power - the authority to make laws. This law-making power is shared by both houses. No <b>bill</b> (proposed law) can become law without the consent of both houses.</p>
<p>Suggestions for bills - be they about education, violence against women, trade with China, gun control or foreign aid - can come from the president, executive agencies, committee staffs, interest groups, or even private individuals. Only Members of the House or Senate, however, can submit a bill to Congress. Every law passed by Congress starts out as a bill, but most bills never become laws. Of the approximately 10,000 or so bills introduced during any session of Congress, fewer than 5 percent are made into law.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="intro-law-stages" class="box ">
			After a Member introduces a bill and it is given a number (for example, HR 238), it must survive two basic stages to be approved by the House of Representatives.

The first takes place when the Speaker of the House refers the bill to the committee that works on that issue. The committee refers the bill to one of its subcommittees, which researches the bill and holds hearings on it. Subcommittee hearings provide opportunities for those on both sides of the issue to voice their opinions. If the subcommittee votes in favor of the bill, the full committee votes and either rejects the bill or sends it to the House floor. Most bills never make it past this stage.

The second stage takes place with all members of the House, on the House floor. There, the bill is debated and members offer changes, or amendments. Finally, the full House votes on the bill.		</div>
			<div id="intro-law-approval" class="box ">
			<img src="http://yli-pub-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/house_of_representatives.jpg" alt="" align="right" />

Even if a bill is approved by a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives, it still must be approved by the Members of the Senate AND by the president - not an easy process. The 114th Congress (2015-2017) considered 12,063 pieces of legislation. Of these, just 329 became laws and 708 were passed resolutions.		</div>

			The Youth Leadership Initiative's E-Congress is an interactive on-line simulation that helps students understand the complexities of the legislative process, as an innovative resource for classroom teachers. Participation in YLI E‑Congress is open and free to middle and high school civics teachers.

Throughout the simulation, students play the part of a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. To be successful, they must research contemporary issues, draft original legislation, debate its merits during committee sessions, and work to move their bill to the House floor. In contrast to traditional mock congresses, students use innovative technology throughout the simulation to interact with their legislators and to connect with their peers around the country.		</div>

			<div id="research-choose-topic" class="box ">
			<p>By now you should have completed Page One of the Phase II Research Guide. The next step is to begin thinking about how you will use this information to write a bill to submit to E-Congress.</p>
<p>  How will you address this issue in writing a bill of your own? For example, if you selected the environment as your topic, you probably realize that you could write several bills; pollution in our waterways, research into alternative sources of energy, drilling for oil in Alaska, and endangered plants and animals are just a few.</p>
<p>  Like you, Members of Congress face this decision every day when attempting to write legislation. Factors for you to consider when selecting a bill to write are listed below, along with student sample legislation from earlier sessions of E-Congress.</p>
<p>  Identify National Issues<br />
  Your bill will get the most support from students in other parts of the country when they feel that it matters to them, too.</p>
<p>  Student Sample: One E-Legislator from Maryland wrote an excellent bill that created more funding to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, it did not pass because students from states other than Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware did not see it as important.</p>
<p>  Needs of Your Constituents<br />
  Remember that a constituent is a person who is represented by a specific elected official. In E-Congress, your constituents are your fellow E-Legislators, students from schools all over the country.</p>
<p>  Student Sample: One E-Legislator authored a bill to increase the minimum wage because he knew his peers (constituents) were interested in earning more money in the part-time jobs they held after school.</p>
<p>  Personal Interest or Expertise<br />
  Many Members of Congress write legislation based on an area where they have specific knowledge or interest. For example, Representative Jack Quinn (R-NY), a former teacher, co-sponsored a bill to prevent bullying in schools.</p>
<p>  Student Sample: Another E-Legislator had a personal interest in the amount of garbage that was being dumped in the ocean. She lived near the coast and was impacted by the pollution, so she proposed a bill to reduce the amount of trash that could be disposed of in open waters.</p>
<p>  Political Party Affiliation<br />
  Members of Congress often sponsor legislation that is a priority to their political party.</p>
<p>  Student Sample: One E-Legislator chose to draft hate crime legislation. He was inspired by personal experience, and he also knew that this issue was an important one to the members of his political party.</p>
<p>  Current Priorities<br />
  Often, bills in Congress reflect events in the news or trends in society.</p>
<p>  Student Sample: One student felt that national security was a priority after the events of September 11, 2001. He proposed that all trains have an armed guard on board to protect the passengers and crew.</p>
<p>  Innovative Solution<br />
  Feel free to come up with a creative approach to solving a tough problem.</p>
<p>  Student Sample: One year a group of students were concerned about the increasing percentage of obesity among America's young people. To combat this, they authored a bill that required school cafeterias to offer fewer high-fat, high-calorie options and increase the number of healthy, fresh foods they served. It was the most successful legislation of the session!</p>
		</div>
			<div id="research-legislation" class="box ">
			<p>For additional ideas on how your topic is addressed by Members of Congress, you should identify what bills are currently being debated in the House of Representatives and the Senate. You may use one or both of the options below.</p>
<p>  <strong>Option One:</strong> Access National Journal Daily<br />
  Each morning Congress is in session, National Journal Daily offers insider news, a comprehensive calendar of the day's events, and exclusive columns on key Congressional decision makers and issues.<br />
  We thank the National Journal for providing E-Legislators with unlimited access to National Journal Daily. This service is only available to E-Legislators for a limited time during the E-Congress simulation.</p>
<p>When you visit the <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/member/daily" target="_blank">National Journal Daily</a> during E-Congress, use the username "ylihelp" and password, "journal".</p>
<p>  <strong>Option Two:</strong> Access <a href="https://www.congress.gov/" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a>, the legislative database run by the Library of Congress that allows you to search for bills currently being considered by the 114th Congress those from earlier sessions. You can search all bills on the House floor or search by keyword. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a> is a free database.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="research-constitution" class="box ">
			<p>Did you know that all laws in the United States must agree with the Constitution? Sometimes Congress passes a law with a conflict, but the law can then be challenged in court. If the Supreme Court decides that a challenged law is unconstitutional, it cannot take effect.</p>
<p>  For example, Gregory Johnson was arrested in Texas for burning an American flag in front of Dallas City Hall. He wished to make a statement against the policies of President Reagan. He was convicted under a Texas law which makes flag desecration (vandalizing or dishonoring a flag) a crime. Although many Texans supported this law, the Supreme Court ruled that burning or otherwise desecrating a flag is protected under the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects the freedom of speech, and it was ruled that other forms of expression, such as Mr. Johnson's political statement of burning the flag, are also forms of speech. Because of this ruling, Mr. Johnson was released from prison, and the Texas law that he was convicted under can no longer be used.</p>
<p>  Click the link below to find out where a bill you write could run into a conflict with the Constitution. If you think your bill might have a conflict, you can still write it. However, you need to consider that your fellow e-Legislators may be less interested in a bill that could be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>  If you want to protect your bill from a Constitutional challenge, consider setting limits on behavior instead of banning it outright. For example, perhaps the Texas flag desecration statute would have been permitted if it simply made flag burning illegal on national holidays, or required a person to get a permit before burning a flag. Also, keep in mind that a potential fight in court will add to the estimated cost of your bill, as you will need to pay for legal fees.</p>

			<p>Now that you have an idea about the type of bill you will be writing, you should consider corresponding with at least one Member of the House of Representatives. Writing to a Member of Congress is a great way to express your opinion to someone who makes decisions about the issues that matter most to Americans.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="

For example, if you think you might write a bill on foreign policy, it might be a good idea to contact a Member on the House Committee on International Relations. The specific committee member you select is up to you, but you may wish to pick one from your state and/or political party. You may also wish to write to one of the Members of the House whose political ideology is similar to your own.</p>

		</div>
			<div id="research-legislation-cost" class="box ">
			<p>The final issue to consider before actually writing your bill is how much your bill will cost. In 2016, the federal government spent over $4.4 trillion - that's $4,400,000,000,000 and a 14% increase from 2015! Needless to say, that's a lot of money. The government spends it on lots of things--on programs as large and popular as Social Security, and on activities as small and unknown as repairs to the National Zoo. Together, these programs are what make up the federal budget. While the budget is written by the president, it must be approved by Congress.</p>
<p>The federal budget is a plan for how the government spends money and for how the government pays for its activities. Each year Congress and the president must decide which programs will be funded and for how much. For example, how much should we spend for defense, national parks, the FBI, Medicare, and meat and fish inspection?<br />
  (from the Office of Management and Budget, <a href="http://yli-pub-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/E-Congress/2018/CitizensGuide_2016.pdf" target="_blank"> A Citizen's Guide to the 2016 Financial Report of the United States Government.</a>)</p>
		</div>
			<div id="research-legislation-revenue" class="box ">
			Congress and the president also have to determine how much income, or <strong>revenue</strong>, is available. The majority of the government's revenue comes from different kinds of taxes-for example, individual income taxes provide about half of the federal government's revenue. The rest comes mostly from payroll and corporate taxes. To create a new program, the government normally gets the money either by cutting funds to an existing program OR by raising taxes.		</div>
			<div id="research-government-spending" class="box ">
			<p>The budget has two large spending categories, <b>mandatory</b> and <b>discretionary</b>. Mandatory spending is required by law on specific programs. After those programs are paid for, the president and Congress may use the remaining money for discretionary spending on programs they choose. Each year, roughly 30 percent of the federal budget is in discretionary spending.</p>
<p>Examples of mandatory and discretionary spending are below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest federal program is Social Security, which provides benefits to over 47 million retired and disabled workers and their families. It accounts for about 21 percent of all federal spending and is required by law, so it is <b>mandatory</b>.</li>
<li>Medicare provides health care coverage for over 40 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicare accounts for an ever-growing share of spending, mostly because the number of Americans over the age of 65 is increasing. Medicare is <b>mandatory</b>.</li>
<li>Medicaid is also <b>mandatory</b> and provides health care services to almost 34 million Americans, including the poor, people with disabilities, and senior citizens in nursing homes. Unlike Medicare, Medicaid is paid for partly by the states.</li>
<li>National defense <b>discretionary</b> spending was $533 billion in 2016, comprising 49% of discretionary spending.</li>
<li>Non-defense <b>discretionary</b> spending includes a wide array of programs such as education, training, science, technology, housing, transportation, and foreign aid.</li>
</ul></p>
		</div>
			<div id="research-spending-examples" class="box ">
			What does this all mean? It means that each year mandatory spending tends to increase because of programs like Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending decreases. Members of Congress have less money to spend on programs they choose because they must spend more on programs that are written into law.

Remember as you write your bill that the committee that considers it may not pass it if they feel it is too expensive.

Based on what you have read, would the bill you plan to write fall into the category of mandatory spending or discretionary spending?		</div>

<p>When President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed the Social Security Act, he didn't call it the "Dignity in Old Age Act" or the "Keep Grandma out of the Poorhouse Act." Lately, things have changed: when Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, a new trend of naming bills more creatively emerged. A tax-cutting bill, for example, was named the "American Dream Restoration Act," and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation bill's name was changed to the "Balanced Budget" bill to garner more favorable attention.</p>
<p>  Representative Barney Frank (D-MA) wondered aloud on the House Floor if the immigration bill entitled the "Immigration in the National Interest Act" should be renamed the "Statue of Liberty Was Wrong Act." One representative, in an attempt to promote a bill requiring football, baseball, basketball, and hockey to use instant replays, named his proposal the "What Really Happened Bill" after rejecting his first choice, "It Wasn't a Touchdown, Stupid, Bill." Below are bill titles from recent of National E-Congresses. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/search?q={%22source%22:%22legislation%22}" target="pop">Click here </a>to view a list of bills currently in Congress.

<p>The next step is to explain the purpose of your legislation. This is the heart of your bill. The title of your bill should grab the attention of your fellow e-Legislators - now it's time to tell them exactly what the title means.</p>
<p>  The purpose does not need to be lengthy, but it should describe the goal(s) of your bill. When other e-Legislators read your purpose statement, they should be able to picture what this bill could do for our country. Read the two examples below. The first is from a Congressional bill; the second is from a student bill in a previous session of E-Congress.</p>

<p>To get yourself started, describe what you hope to accomplish or the problem you plan to solve. Try to state it in a way that shows your fellow E-Legislators why this issue is important and deserving of their attention. Remember, you will need their support.</p>
<p>  Next, describe the steps your bill will take to solve the problem. You don't need to discuss details like exactly who the bill applies to or how much it will cost; those will be included in the next few sections. You do need to mention specific actions that your bill requires, such as creating an agency or program, setting a standard, or instituting a penalty. Below is another example from a previous session of E-Congress. Doesn't the author of this bill make it seem like a good idea?</p>
<p>  <strong>TITLE</strong>: A Bill to Reduce the Emissions of Vehicle Pollutants into the Atmosphere<br />
  <strong>PURPOSE</strong>:<br />
  1.	To establish new Federal programs and standards to reduce the emissions of vehicle pollutants into the atmosphere.<br />
  2.	To increase the fuel standards on new vehicles.<br />
  3.	To promote the development of fuel cells and hybrid vehicles thus reducing dependence on fossil fuels.<br />
  4.	To impose regulations on newly produced farming equipment in order to reduce air pollution in rural areas.</p>
<p>  To help you determine what your purpose might be review the following sample purpose statements from previous E-Congress bills.</p>
<p>  <strong>TITLE</strong>: Quit the Quotas Bill<br />
  <strong>PURPOSE</strong>: A bill to ensure that college entry acceptance is based on test and academic scores, notable achievements and volunteer service, not upon quotas of race and/or gender.</p>
<p>  <strong>TITLE</strong>: Universal Health Coverage<br />
  <strong>PURPOSE</strong>: This bill is intended to provide health care for all American citizens.</p>
<p>  <strong>TITLE</strong>: Improve and Better Our Schools Act<br />
  <strong>PURPOSE</strong>: The purpose of this bill is to provide an equal education for children in poverty-stricken areas by providing funds for essential school supplies.</p>

		</div>
			<div id="writing-eligibility" class="box ">
			<p><a title="REPLACEMENTTITLE" href="REPLACEMENTURL" onClick="REPLACEMENTONCLICK">Work on Your Bill</a></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong><br />
  This step of the bill-writing process asks you to identify which groups of people will be affected by the bill you propose. This should be the people who will receive a benefit or penalty if your legislation is enacted. For example, one group of students wrote a bill that increased the minimum wage for workers who were drug-free. Read their eligibility section below:</p>
<p>  <strong>SECTION 3. ELIGIBILITY.</strong><br />
  An individual will receive a minimum of $7.50 per hour if he or she<br />
  (1) is legally employed at any American business;<br />
  (2) has a work permit;<br />
  (3) passes a federally regulated drug test at least once a year.</p>
<p>  Notice that this eligibility section is very specific. In #1, the authors explain that to be eligible, workers must be legally entitled to work, a provision that would eliminate illegal immigrants and any other undocumented workers. Item #2 includes all workers who are legal immigrants to the United States but not yet citizens. You may have heard this work permit called a green card. Finally, #3 requires that eligible workers pass a drug test at least once a year.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="writing-eligibility-examples" class="box ">
			<p><a title="REPLACEMENTTITLE" href="REPLACEMENTURL" onClick="REPLACEMENTONCLICK">Work on Your Bill</a></p>
<p>Defining eligibility is a good first step toward thinking about how much your bill will cost, something you will be deciding shortly. The more people your bill affects, the more it is likely to cost. For instance, if your eligibility includes all Americans, it will cost much more than if it only applies to college graduates who would like to become public school teachers as in the example below.</p>
<p>  <strong>TITLE:</strong> Educate Our Teachers Act of 2003<br />
  <strong>ELIGIBILITY:</strong><br />
  An individual may apply if he or she<br />
  (1) has a baccalaureate degree in any academic field<br />
  (2) is a citizen of the United States<br />
  (3) is above the age of 22<br />
  (4) uses loan of $10,000 per year for the furthering of their master's degree</p>
<p>  Here are some additional examples of eligibility statements from previous sessions of E-Congress. They may be helpful to you as you try to create your own statement of eligibility.</p>
<p>  <strong>TITLE:</strong> Stem Cell Research Testing Bill<br />
  <strong>PURPOSE:</strong> To provide federal funding to volunteers who have agreed to submit to testing the effectiveness of stem cell research on neurodegenerative and celluar diseases.<br />
  <strong>ELIGIBILITY:</strong><br />
  1. Is a legal resident of the United States of America<br />
  2. Has a neurodegenerative or celluar disease.<br />
  3. Are as yet untreated.</p>
<p>  <strong>TITLE:</strong> Electric makes more sense<br />
  <strong>PURPOSE:</strong> A bill aimed towards lowering pollution by increasing the sale of electric and hybrid cars.<br />
  <strong>ELIGIBILITY:</strong> All individuals who currently hold a US drivers license.</p>

<p>This section of your bill adds detail to the general information in the Purpose and Eligibility sections of your legislation. You will now need to think about what specific requirements your bill will contain. You may want to consider how many people can be served by your bill or how long the bill will be in effect.</p>
<p>  You read a sample piece of legislation from a previous session of E-Congress, entitled "Educate Our Teachers Act of 2003," when writing your eligibility section. This bill provided financial aid for those interested in going to graduate school to become teachers. Teachers could repay their loans by agreeing to work in the public schools for two years after graduation. Read the Terms and Benefits of this same bill below:</p>
<p>  <strong>TERMS AND BENEFITS</strong></p>
<p>  1. Participants will receive loans of up to $10,000 per year ($20,000 over two years) for a term not exceeding two years in order to achieve a master's degree in any field of education;</p>
<p>  2. A six-month training institute is required, and after completion participants will be placed at a school;</p>
<p>  3. Teacher salary is left to the discretion of the local school board;</p>
<p>  4. For the first year the number of participants chosen will not exceed 1,000 people and will increase thereafter according to the success of the program;</p>
<p>  5. Participants will be eligible for education awards of $4,725 for each year of service ($9,450 over two years) to be applied to student loans;</p>
<p>  6. Transportation and/or living expenses are covered by the program during the six-month institute period and up to two months after placement at a site.</p>
<p>  Just like the authors of this bill, you need to be as specific as you can in writing your Terms and Benefits. Other E-Legislators are more likely to support a bill that covers each of the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which Americans would be affected by this bill? All? Only those under 18? Potential immigrants? Anyone with a driver's license?</li>
<li>What benefits or penalties would this bill create?</li>
<li>Who will enforce the terms of this bill?</li>
<li>How long will your bill be in effect? One year? Five?</li>

<p>Professor Larry Sabato at the University of Virginia says, "the work that takes place in the committee and subcommittee rooms of Capitol Hill is critical to the productivity and effectiveness of Congress." As discussed in the Introduction Phase, all bills are debated in at least one committee. Additionally, a subcommittee may choose to hold public hearings on a particular bill. A bill must be approved by a majority of committee members before it can move on to the House Floor.</p>
<p>Remember, in Congress most bills never make it past this step.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="committee-responsibility" class="box ">
			<p><img src="http://yli-pub-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tictac.jpg" alt="" align="right"/></p>
<p>Your responsibility as an E-Legislator will now shift from writing legislation to reviewing legislation as a member of a committee. You and your classmates will read bills written by other students around the country. Members of your committee will discuss and evaluate each piece of legislation.</p>
<p>It is not easy for a large group of people to reach agreement. It is even harder when the group is discussing some of the controversial issues that may arise in your committee meetings. Below are a few suggestions from experienced members of Congress about working effectively in a committee.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critically review each bill</strong> - Before beginning your group discussion, read through each bill. Use the Bill Review Guide provided by your teacher to take notes as you read.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate your ideas effectively</strong> - When discussing each bill with the other members of your committee, keep your comments short and to the point. Use your notes to refer to specifics from the bill you are discussing. Above all, be calm and polite at all times.</li>
<li><strong>Create alliances</strong> - You may want to talk to other members of the committee who share your political ideology. This way you can group together to support bills that interest you.</li>
<li><strong>Build consensus</strong> - Usually the word you might hear when making decisions is compromise. However, compromise implies that each person must give up one thing to gain another. Consensus, on the other hand, is an agreement reached by a whole group. Even if your committee is unable to reach consensus on a bill, you may be able to reach consensus on when it is time to vote or whether to stop discussing a certain issue.</li>
</ul>
		</div>
			<div id="committee-guidelines" class="box ">
			<ol>
	<li>Review each bill and take notes before meeting as a committee. Record your thoughts about each bill on your Bill Review Guide.</li>
	<li>Members should build consensus as they review each bill, choosing from the following legislative actions:</br></br>
<table width="70%" align="center">

Your committee must write the amendment you want and then your teacher or a student designated by your teacher will enter it as a comment. Amendments should be specific in nature and not in the form of a question. The author(s) of the bill will review the proposed amendment.</p> 

<p>If the author(s) accept the amendment, they will edit the bill accordingly, submit it to their teachers who will then reveiw the changes and submit it back to the committee teacher who will approve the bill. The author(s) may choose to submit a counter proposal to the amendment which will follow a similar course back to the committee's teacher.  The committee must then discuss the counter proposal. If it is accepted by the committee, the committee then informs their teacher who will approve the bill. If the committee does not agree with the counter proposal, it can have the bill returned again to the author or Reject the bill if it appears that a resolution is unlikely.  Keep in mind that any bills in the amendment process that have not been Approved or Rejected by Tuesday, March 13nd will not go on to the House Floor.</p></td>

<p>NOTE: Even if you have been working with a partner (or partners) to sponsor legislation, you may log in and cast your votes independently on the House Floor.</p>

<li>Set priorities. There may be more bills on the House Floor than you have time to consider. That is okay! This actually happens in Congress quite a bit. Members of Congress must decide what issues are most important to them and to their constituents, so you should do the same. Bills will be grouped by topic, so one suggestion is to limit the number of topics on which you will vote.</li>
<li>Before voting, read each piece of legislation carefully and evaluate its merits.</li>
<li>As an E-Legislator, you may cast a vote for each bill in the House Floor. You can choose from the following legislative actions.<br />

			<h3>History of YLI</h3>
<p>During the 1998 Congressional elections, national voter turnout was the lowest it had been since 1942. University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato, troubled by the pervasive apathy and cynicism surrounding politics that he saw in the students in his classroom, recognized an opportunity to combat this lack of interest or engagement in government by educating students in kindergarten through 12<sup>th</sup> grade about their rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States.</p>
<p>The Youth Leadership Initiative (YLI) was established in 1999 as a pilot program with 14 schools in the state of Virginia. It now provides public and private schools in all 50 states, D.C., US territories and other schools around the world with a comprehensive program of technology-based civics education resources, housed online through the YLI website. The academic materials combine lesson plans with civic participation activities so that students can experience directly what it means to live in a representative democracy.</p>

<h3>National E-Congress</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students work through five different phases (introduction, research, writing, committee, and house floor) to learn about the workings of Congress</li>
<li>The <u>2017 National E-Congress will take place from January 4 through April 6</u>.</li>
<li>Each phase of the bill creation process is broken down into manageable segments.</li>
<li>Teacher Instructions, calendar and supporting lesson plans make E-Congress easy for teachers to implement.</li>
<li>The committee and amendment phase allows classrooms to debate and compromise on bills before sending them to the house floor. </li>
<li>Bills that pass the Committee and Amendment phases move on to the House Floor and are voted on by students from around the nation.</li>
<li>Participation in the National E-Congress, as with all YLI programs, is FREE to registered educators.  Sign up now to gain access to all YLI resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My E-Congress</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to run an E-Congress session at any time during the school year</li>
<li>Has accompanying lesson plans that demonstrate how to adapt our E-Congress technology for use in your classroom</li>
<li>Is the same as the National E-Congress except that you do not interact with other schools</li>
</ul>
<p>Get in the game by writing and passing your own original piece of legislation!  Student legislators from across the nation participate each year in the National E-Congress analyzing over thousands of pieces of original legislation.</p>

			<p>YLI's E-Congress allows students to simulate the role of a representative in the United States Congress, by researching and drafting legislation, debating it in legislative committees and voting. YLI now has two versions of E-Congress.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>National E-Congress</strong> joins your students with thousands of others across the country and takes place from early January until mid-April. International classrooms are also encouraged to participate.</li>
<li>Those unable to participate in the National E-Congress due to time constraints may create their own <strong>My E-Congress</strong> at any time. The only difference is there is no interaction or voting between schools. See the My E-Congress User's Guide in the downloads below.</li>
</ul>
<p>The E-Congress Demo gives you the opportunity to view the program prior to having your students participate in the actual program. It highlights all five phases of E-Congress and helps you to prepare for the incredible learning experience that is the YLI E-Congress. <a href="/econgress/demoGET_SESSION">Click here</a> to view the E-Congress Demo.</p>

			<p>The YLI Democracy Corps answers students’ questions about why we have a democracy and what responsibilities citizens have in being a part of it.  Students then move quickly from the blackboard to the blacktop as they interact with local political leaders, grass-root organizations and citizens to deliberate solutions to real problems and influence public policy.</p>

<h3>What is Democracy Corps?</h3>

<p>Democracy Corps is a service learning program that can easily be infused into your civics education program.  It takes what you do in the classroom and empowers students to use that information out in the real world.  The program teaches about the responsibilities of citizenship and then uses the skills of democracy- discussion, debate and compromise- to allow students the opportunity to create real changes to their communities. By discussing relevant political problems, deliberating solutions and proposing action students are more likely to be civically active as adults.  Salient research shows that students who discuss politics in class are 91 percent more likely to express interest in issues facing the nation, join a group to solve problems, contact an elected official, volunteer in the community, or work for a political party.</p>

<p>Democracy Corps builds on the rich experiences of Service Learning programs by placing the needs of charitable organizations in the context of government and civics-related issues.  As Ken Stroupe,  Chief of Staff for the Center for Politics, has said, “During the fleeting moment when students are taking an active interest in the needs of their community, it is negligent to miss the opportunity to also connect them with the larger world of government and public policy.”</p>

<p>Consisting of lesson plans, worksheets and skill development exercises, Democracy Corps has everything a teacher needs to implement a successful service learning project.  Scheduling options within the program make it convenient for teachers with varying schedules and demands.  As with all YLI programs, Democracy Corps is available FREE of charge to registered educators.  <a href="/signup/">Sign Up</a> now.</p>		</div>

			<p>The Democracy Corps Teacher Resource Guide is divided into four phases. Information and experiences build on each other as students move through each phase, so it may be confusing for students if they skip sections or complete them out of order. For teachers who have a limited amount of time, there is a Fast Track version. </p>
<h3>Phase One: Build a Foundation for Political Participation</h3>
<p>This phase introduces students to the concepts of democracy and challenges them to explain when and why citizens should be involved in the political process. Phase One also includes an analysis of community needs and culminates with student selection of their target Democracy Corps issue. </p>
<h3>Phase Two: Serve the Community </h3>
<p>Phase two broadens student understanding of their target issue through a hands-on community service project. Highlights of this phase include direct contact with community experts in the students’ service learning field and first-hand experiences with the issue they are addressing. </p>
<h3>Phase Three: Interact with Political Leaders </h3>
<p>Students continue to focus on their target issue, but public interactions move from community experts to political leaders. Student goals are to determine what local or state division of governments addresses their issue, what, if any, policy decisions are currently being considered and how they can participate in the conversation to impact change. </p>
<h3>Phase Four: Influence Public Policy </h3>
<p>Students compile information gathered during the first three phases in preparation for a political rally or formal presentation to political leaders, civic leaders on a group of their peers. They conclude the project evaluating the effectiveness of their political impact and the value of involvement in our democracy.</p>

			<p>Use the following Democracy Corps Lesson Plans to enhance and guide your service learning program.</p>
		</div>
			<div id="how-much-time" class="box ">
			<p>The time required for Democracy Corps will vary based on the needs of students and teacher time constraints. The most effective experiences for students occur when teachers weave the Comprehensive Democracy Corps Plan throughout a nine-month government or civics course. If this amount of time is prohibitive, the project can be completed in an eight-week consecutive block or as quickly as three weeks if teachers choose the Fast Track. </p>
<h3>Comprehensive Plan</h3>
<p>The Comprehensive Plan involves integrating Democracy Corps lessons into standard government units throughout the school year. Instead of teaching political involvement in isolation, teachers blend textbook information with hands-on Democracy Corps experiences. This approach requires the most planning, but affords students the greatest return since they immediately apply and evaluate the civic concepts they are learning. </p>
<h3>Eight-Week Plan</h3>
<p>Teachers who choose to complete Democracy Corps in eight weeks may begin at any point in the year and follow the lessons consecutively from the beginning of Phase One through the end of Phase Four. This is an excellent way to familiarize oneself with the material while providing students a full Democracy Corps experience. </p>
<h3>Fast Track</h3>
<p>The Fast Track provides a road map for completing Democracy Corps in three weeks. The critical lessons in each phase are identified and teachers are encouraged to move through this abbreviated plan chronologically. </p>
<h3>Resources </h3>
<p>Each phase includes lesson plans, resource materials, rubrics and daily student guides. All of the materials may be modified to meet the needs of diverse learners and student guides feature the following tips. </p>
<p>•	Deliberation questions foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br />
•	Suggestions for differentiated instruction based on learning styles and/or student skill levels.<br />
•	Creative ideas to implement interactive technology

<strong>Lesson Plan 4: Contemporary Issues in the News – Part One</strong><br />
<strong>Lesson Plan 5: Contemporary Issues in the News – Part Two</strong><br />
<strong>Lesson Plan 8: Identify Target Issue</strong>
</div>
<p>Students skip lessons that explain the role of a democracy and outline civic responsibilities. Through the lessons listed above, they move directly to assessing needs in their community and selecting one issue to address as their Democracy Corps project. </p>
<h3>Phase Two: Serve the Community</h3>
<p>(No activity required)</p>
<p>Students do not complete the service learning component of the project. Even though this portion of Democracy Corps offers valuable interactions with experts in the field and compelling first-hand experience, students may move directly to political involvement.</p>
<h3>Phase Three: Interact with Political Leaders</h3>

<div style="float:left; width:75%;" class="vspace">
<strong>Lesson Plan 11: Attend a Government Meeting or Shadow a Political Leader</strong>
</div>
<p>Phase Three requires students to apply their citizenship skills as they explore how local government relates to their target issue and as they interact with political leaders though individual interviews or political meetings. During the Fast Track, students eliminate discussions with political leaders who have opposing views and they do not complete YLI E-Congress. </p>

			<p>Webster's formal definition for deliberation is to &ldquo;consult with another or other in a process of reaching a decision.&rdquo; This form of decision-making is at the heart of our democratic process, therefore healthy and lively deliberation is encouraged as often as possible throughout the Democracy Corps project.</p>
<p>The deliberation guidelines offered below are designed to give structure to classroom discussions. This list is adapted from the work of Mortimer Adler, author of the Paideia Proposal, who views seminars as a core method of instruction. From our experience, this approach is one way to guarantee an informative and enjoyable experience for student participants. We agree with Mr. Adler in that &quot;there is no educational experience that is more transformational for students than guided dialogue with their peers. (<a href="http://www.paideia.org" target="_blank">paideia.org</a>)</p>
<p>Guidelines for deliberation are listed below along with a quick-reference guide in the back pocket of the book and a rubric for assessment.</p>
