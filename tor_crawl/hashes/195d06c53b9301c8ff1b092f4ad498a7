<p>Glad you assholes had your fun abusing my server as a proxy.<br>That's over now, remove my server from your proxy configuration.<br>I'd also like to add that y'all are illegally using my server as a proxy without my permission. This page is not a fluke, the misconfiguration that allowed this has been resolved, this IP <b>WILL NOT</b> proxy for you, or anyone else, again. Good day!</p>
