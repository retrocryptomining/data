These are the output files generated by our cm-screener.

The first field in each CSV is the domain, followed by the text in the HTML that matched our regex:

- 2018-01-31, 2018-03-12, and 2018-07-29 are scans of the Alexa Top1m list
- The others are larger-scale scans as described in the paper. Note that we scanned multiple IPs per domain, and the file contains all results. If you count by unique domain, you arrive at the numbers in the paper.

We also provide the files that correspond to our random sampling to determine the true positive rate.
